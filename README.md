### Model Evaluation Pipeline
This project evaluates multiple machine learning models (Neural Network, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree) on a shared dataset using common regression metrics (MSE, MAPE, RÂ²). The workflow includes preprocessing data, training models, saving results, and generating comparative plots.

ðŸ”§ How to Run the Program
1. Run Preprocessing Script
This step analyzes, cleans, and prepares the original dataset for model input. After running this script: 
Original and processed datasets will be stored in the dataset/ folder.

2. Run Each Model Script
Each model has its own script for training, evaluating, and saving results. These scripts read the processed dataset and write metrics (MSE, MAPE, RÂ²) to CSVs in the results/ folder.

NOTE: Neural Network should take ~ 1/2 Hours, SVR about ~45 Minutes, and Decision Tree a couple seconds

3. Run Postprocessing Script to Generate Comparison Charts
This script reads all model results from the results/ folder, aligns the data, and creates comparative boxplots and violin plots of model performance for each error metric.
